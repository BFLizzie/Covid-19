# COVID-19 Outbreak Analysis in Africa
## Project Overview
This project analyses COVID-19 data across African countries to identify trends and differences in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccination rates, testing rates, and healthcare accessibility.  
Python and Power BI were used to clean, analyse, and visualize the data to better understand how the pandemic impacted different regions of Africa.

## Problem Statement
COVID-19 affected African countries differently. Some countries recorded higher numbers of cases and deaths, while others showed better recovery outcomes or stronger healthcare systems.
This project aims to understand these differences and examine how factors such as vaccination, testing, healthcare access, and ICU bed availability influenced COVID-19 outcomes across Africa.

## Project Objectives
The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which regions or countries recorded the highest and lowest:
  - Total confirmed cases
  - Total deaths
  - Total recoveries
  - Active cases
  - Critical cases

- Which regions or countries recorded:
  - The highest and lowest death rates  
  - The highest and lowest recovery rates  
  - The highest and lowest vaccination rates  
  - The highest and lowest testing rates

- In which regions or countries was:
  - Healthcare most and least accessible
  - ICU bed availability most and least accessible

- Which regions or countries received the largest and lowest healthcare funds

## Tools Used
#### Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Power BI  

## Data Source
- COVID-19 dataset sourced from Kaggle
- Dataset includes:
  - Confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries  
  - Vaccination and testing data  
  - Healthcare accessibility and ICU bed indicators  

## Project Methodology
### Data Cleaning
The following data cleaning steps were carried out:
- Checked for and removed duplicate records  
- Identified and handled missing values  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types  
- Removed commas and unnecessary symbols from numeric fields  
- Verified calculated fields such as death rate, recovery rate, and testing rate  
- Ensured consistency in country and region names  

After cleaning, the dataset was ready for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis was performed using Python (Pandas) and Power BI
- Analysis focused on identifying COVID-19 trends across African countries and regions

### Data Visualization
- Python (Matplotlib): Bar charts  
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards  

## Key Findings and Insights
### COVID-19 Cases
- Highest total cases: Nigeria 
- Lowest total cases: Angola
- Nigeria recorded the highest number of infections, indicating faster virus spread. Angola’s low case count may be due to limited spread, testing constraints, or early control measures.

### COVID-19 Deaths
- Highest total deaths: Nigeria
- Lowest total deaths: Angola
- Nigeria’s high death count aligns with its high number of cases. Angola’s low deaths may reflect fewer cases or limited reporting.

### Recoveries
- Highest total recoveries: Nigeria  
- Lowest total recoveries: Angola
- High recovery figures in Nigeria correspond with high infection levels, while Angola’s low recoveries reflect fewer reported cases.

### Active Cases
- Highest active cases: Nigeria
- Lowest active cases: Niger
- Nigeria’s high active cases suggest continued transmission, while Niger’s low figures may indicate better containment or limited reporting.

### Critical Cases
- Highest critical cases: Nigeria
- Lowest critical cases: Angola
- Nigeria experienced greater pressure on healthcare facilities, while Angola recorded fewer critical cases.

### Healthcare Funding
- Largest healthcare funds: Nigeria
- Smallest healthcare funds: Tanzania
- Nigeria received the highest healthcare funding, while Tanzania recorded the lowest allocation.

### Death Rate
- Highest death rate: Mali
- Lowest death rate: Angola
- Mali’s high death rate may indicate weaker healthcare capacity or delayed response. Angola’s low death rate may reflect early intervention.

### Recovery Rate
- Highest recovery rate: Niger  
- Lowest recovery rate: Angola
- High recovery rates in Niger suggest effective treatment or milder cases, while Angola’s low rate may be linked to reporting delays.

### Vaccination Rate
- Highest vaccination rate: Morocco
- Lowest vaccination rate: Mali
- Morocco achieved strong vaccination coverage through effective rollout strategies, while Mali faced access challenges.

### Testing Rate
- Highest testing rate: Kenya  
- Lowest testing rate: Zambia  
- Higher testing levels in Kenya supported better tracking, while Zambia’s low testing rate reflects resource constraints.

### Healthcare Accessibility
- Most accessible healthcare: Nigeria 
- Least accessible healthcare: Angola
- Nigeria shows greater healthcare availability, while Angola’s low access may affect early treatment outcomes.

### ICU Bed Accessibility
- Most accessible ICU beds: Nigeria  
- Least accessible ICU beds: Niger  
- Nigeria’s ICU capacity supports critical care, while Niger’s limited ICU beds highlight healthcare gaps.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how COVID-19 affected African countries differently. Countries such as Nigeria recorded high case numbers and healthcare activity, while others such as Angola and Niger reported lower figures.  
Overall, the analysis shows that stronger healthcare systems, improved testing, and accurate reporting contribute to better pandemic response and outcomes.

## Recommendations
- Increase investment in healthcare infrastructure in low-capacity countries  
- Strengthen vaccination campaigns in low-coverage regions  
- Improve disease surveillance, testing, and reporting systems  
- Encourage regional collaboration and resource sharing across Africa
